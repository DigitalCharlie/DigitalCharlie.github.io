          I served as the Digital Coordinator for the People's Climate March â€” the single largest mobilization demanding action on climate change in history with more than 400,000 people showing up in the streets of New York City.

          I conceptualized, researched, and built this website that connects Donald Trump's racist campaign language to the dog whistle politics used by the Republican Party.

        <p>
          I served as the Digital Coordinator for the March for Real Climate Leadership, which at the time was the largest anti-fracking mobilization in history. In addition to managing digital outreach, I also designed and built the march's website.

      <div class="project_description">
        <p>
          I conceptualized, designed, and built this website that presents a variety of horrific facts about the TPP in a compelling, but accessible manner (at least for people who don't mind strong language).

      <div class="project_description">
        <p>
          I conceptualized, designed, and built this website that used interactivity to drive home the fact that the TPP was kept secret during negotiations about giving negotiators Fast Track Authority. It generated more than half a million hits within the first three days of launch.

          I coordinated the Stop Watching Us Rally, the largest on the ground mobilization opposing mass surveillance in the wake of the Snowden Revelations. I came up with the initial plan, found funding, and brought partners to the table to make the rally a success.
